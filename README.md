# gridCarbon
Package to support analysis of UK &amp; NZ electricity grid carbon intensity data. Based on original Otago/gridCarbon

Inspired by:

 * [Staffell 2017](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421516307017) (UK analysis)
 * [Khan et al, 2018](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652618306474) (NZ Analysis)

Started out as part of a [CfS](https://cfsotago.github.io/) summer student scholarship project and has evolved into something slightly larger and more complicated :-)

## Results

Reports and results best viewed on github [pages](https://dataknut.github.io/gridCarbon/).

 * GB [wind/solar vs coal/gas generation mix](https://dataknut.github.io/gridCarbon/rmd/gbGenMixTrends.html) over time (inspired by https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1508409309775994892)
 * Analysis of [GB generation mix and emissions](https://git.soton.ac.uk/ba1e12/gbLockdownElecPaper) during COVID19 2020 lockdown:
   * Anderson, B., & James, P. (2021). Covid-19 lockdown: impacts on GB electricity demand and CO2 emissions. Buildings and Cities, 2(1), 134â€“149. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/bc.77
 * Analysis of New Zealand [electricity generation emissions](https://dataknut.github.io/nzGridCarbonPaper/) (tl;dr: renewable ! necessarily = low emissions...)

## Data sources
